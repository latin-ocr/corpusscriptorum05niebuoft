APPENDIX. 535

The consuls Laevinus and ancauim, who entered upon
their consulship in the spring of B. C. 280, are placed by this
Chronicle in Ol. 124. 4. which nearly· agrees with their true
position l). But, in the following period, by the omission
of four pairs of consuls 2), the consuls are thrown back ab·
ove their actual daie in the following manner.

Ol. 124. 4. [125. 1.] Laevinus and coruncanius.
* B. C. 270. Genucius and ‚Cornelius omitted.
127. 2. [127. 4.] Gallus and Pictor.
129. 3. [130. 1.] Scipio and Duilius.
* Β. C. 237. Caudinus and Flaccus om. ³)

Therefore the 1st Jotham and 01. 1. 3. would foll in A. M. 4734.
and the 51st Uzziah and 01. 1. 1. ἰιι Α. Μ. 4732. The nativity os
Christ is placed p. 263. [ed. Bonn. p. 194. 2.] ἐπὶ τῶν ’ὑπάτων
Δεντοῦλου καὶ Πίσωνος ἔτους ‘apg‘ γενέσεως κοσμου. But 5507—
4732=775. The dates therefore are consistent. His date for the
foundation of Rome is given p. 239. [ed. Bonn. p. 204. 2.] τῷ τετάρ-
τῳ ἔτει ἑβδόμης ὀλυμπιάδος - Ῥῶμος καὶ Ῥῆμος κτίζουσι τὴν
Ῥώμην. The date of Varro coincides with Ol. 6. 3., and of the
Marbles with ol. 6. 4. From another notice of this author, p. 280.
[ed:Bonn. p. 529.11.] B.C.751. results as his era for the foundation
of Rome: Olymp. 277. 3. ἔτους τοί τῆς εἰς ου’ραυοῦς ἀναλήψεως

nus, according to Syncellus, placed the first Olympiad at the first
year of Ahaz. It might therefore have commenced iu the last year
of Jotham. If the author of the Chronicle intended to express that
Africanus placed it in the beginning of Jotham’s reign, he probably
gave an erroneous representation. [It appears trom the Armenian
copy os Eusebius p. 319. that the author of the Chronicle transcri-
bed this passage [ἡ πρώτη ὄλυμπιάς κ. τ. 1.] from Eusebius himself:
who therefore gave this erroneous representation of the Chronology
of Africanus. ο ἡμέτερος κανών accordingly means the canon of
Eusebius. See Scaliger prolegom. p. 6. 7. Addit. p. 567.]
1) Their consulship in reality perhaps coincided with. 01. {3} “²1- the
end of the former year and the beginning of the latter. ’
2) In reality‚ five years omitted: but, as one year is interpolat-ed,
· this leaves an actual deficieucy of four consulships.
3) The three years,
Γράκχου καὶ Φάλκωνοσ,
Καυδίνου καὶ moino„
Καυδίνου καὶ Οὐάρου
became
Γράκχου καὶ Φλάκου,
Κλαυδίου καὶ Οὐάρου.
