APPENDIX. ” 537

Δ metachronism of five years in these events, as compa-
red with the consulships to which they are referred.

With the exception of these omissions‚ (producing these
consequences‚) the list of consuls in the Chronicle, from B.
C. 280. to the reign of Augustus, corresponds with the list
obtained from the other testimonies3 with only such variations
as might arise, for the'most part, from a transcribet in ex-
pressing Roman names in Greek characters.

From the consulship of Agrippa and Gallus, the list of
consuls in the Chronicle varies so much from the true list,
that a view of both islnecessary to be given. The following
columns exhibit the true list of consuls and the list of the
Alexandrina Chronicle. That list begins, as we have seen,
five years too high: which produces a metachronism os five
years in assigning the first year of Augustus 1).

 

1) The Chronicle ascribes to Caesar five years, and to Augustus 563
computing the reign of Augustus from the death of Caesar. The
two reigns therefore are 5 -Ι- 56 = 61 years. But these 61 years,
being made to begin at the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa B. C.
43, instead of caesar and Isauricus B. C. 48, are compared treug-
hout with the wrong consuls.
