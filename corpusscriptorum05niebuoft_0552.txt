542. APPENDIX.

The deficiency of five years in the preceding period is
here compensated by the interpolation of five consulships ι).
Four years ars restored to the reign of Augustus by four in·'
terpolations3 and the metachronism, which was five years in
the first year of his reign, in the 56th is seduced to one.
Taurus and Libo, the second consuls of Tvberius, are in the
Chronicle the first. Another interpolated year brings back the
16th of Tiberius to its true place3 and Vinicius and Longinam,
his 16th consuls, are also the 16th in the Chronicle. When
these interpolations are struck out, the two lists will nearly
correspond, except in a very few instances, where the Chro-
nicle has transposed the consuls. In the strange error of di-
viding the two Sexti and the two Gemini each into two years,

1) In reality seven pairs of consuls are interpolated, which are mer-
ked thus *ε 11111, as two are omitted, the overplus is thus reduced
to five ears.

, 2) Epipffanius in part agrees with the list of the Chronicle' m the

thirty pairs of consuls from B. C. 2. U. C. 752. to A. D. 28.

U. C. 781. Althoug he is more free from error than the Chronicle.

Having given those thirty consulships down to Silanus aud Nerva

inclusive, Epiphanius proceeds thus. p..446 Β. νπατεία τῶν δύο
